  <img src="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/thumbnails/image/52887134031_787ea27a36_k.jpg?itok=ki1Cjcgd" class="img-fluid" alt="">
  <p>NASA will provide live coverage as two Roscosmos cosmonauts conduct a spacewalk outside the International Space Station Thursday, June 22, for station upgrades and retrieval of equipment.

    Coverage will begin at 9:45 a.m. EDT on NASA Television, the NASA app, and the agency’s website. The spacewalk is expected to begin about 10:20 a.m. and last up to seven hours.</p>
  <p>Expedition 69 cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin will venture outside the station’s Poisk airlock to retrieve several experiment packages and install communications equipment.

    The spacewalk will be the seventh for Prokopyev, who will wear the Orlan spacesuit with the red stripes, and the fifth for Petelin, who will wear the spacesuit with the blue stripes.</p>
  <h3>NASA Sets Coverage for Axiom Mission 2 Departure from Space Station</h3>
  <img src="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/thumbnails/image/iss069e014094orig.jpeg?itok=x1DAxkeJ" class="img-fluid" alt="">
  <p>NASA will provide live coverage of the undocking and departure of Axiom Mission 2 (Ax-2) private astronaut mission from the International Space Station before crew returns to Earth.

    The four-member multinational astronaut crew is scheduled to undock no earlier than 11:05 a.m. EDT Tuesday, May 30, from the space-facing port of the station’s Harmony module in a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft to begin the journey home and splashdown off the coast of Florida.
    
    NASA will begin live coverage of space station joint operations with Axiom Space and SpaceX, starting with hatch closure preparations at 9 a.m. Tuesday, May 30, on NASA Television, the NASA app, and the agency’s website.</p>
  <p>Mission teams will monitor weather at the possible splashdown sites prior to undocking to ensure conditions are acceptable for a safe recovery of the spacecraft and Ax-2 astronauts.

    Ax-2 Commander Peggy Whitson, Pilot John Shoffner, and Mission Specialists Ali Alqarni and Rayyanah Barnawi, both representing the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, will complete approximately nine days in space at the conclusion of their mission. Their SpaceX Dragon will return to Earth with more than 300 pounds of cargo, including NASA hardware and data from over 20 different experiments.</p>
  <h3>NASA to Provide Briefing, Coverage of Spacewalks for Station Upgrades</h3>
  <img src="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/thumbnails/image/iss069e005732orig.jpeg?itok=mIuRidYM" class="img-fluid" alt="">
  <p>Each spacewalk is scheduled to begin at 9:15 a.m. and last about six-and-a-half hours with NASA coverage beginning at 7:45 a.m.

    On June 9, NASA astronauts Steve Bowen and Woody Hoburg will exit the station’s Quest airlock to install an upgraded IROSA (International Space Station Roll-Out Solar Array) on the 1A power channel on the starboard truss of the station.
    
    Bowen will serve as extravehicular activity (EVA) crew member 1 and will wear a suit with red stripes. Hoburg will serve as extravehicular crew member 2 and will wear an unmarked suit. U.S. EVA 87 will be the ninth spacewalk for Bowen and the first for Hoburg.</p>
  <p>On June 15, the same pair of astronauts will install an IROSA on the 1B power channel on the starboard truss. During this spacewalk, Hoburg will serve as EVA crew member 1 and Bowen will serve as EVA crew member 2.

    The second spacewalk will begin at 8:55 a.m. and last approximately six hours with NASA coverage beginning at 7:30 a.m.
    
    The spacewalks will see the fifth and sixth IROSAs mounted to the existing station solar arrays. The new arrays are 60 feet long by 20 feet wide (18.2 meters by 6 meters) and will shade a little more than half of the original arrays, which are 112 feet long by 39 feet wide. Each new IROSA will produce more than 20 kilowatts of electricity, and once all are installed, will enable a 30% increase in power production over the station’s current arrays.</p>
  <h3>New Mexico Students to Hear from NASA Astronauts Aboard Space Station</h3>
  <img src="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/thumbnails/image/iss069e005093.jpeg?itok=a6rrnz9f" class="img-fluid" alt="">
  <p>Students from southern New Mexico schools will have an opportunity to hear from NASA astronauts aboard the International Space Station.

    The Earth-to-space call will air live at 12:30 p.m. EDT Tuesday, May 30, on NASA Television, the NASA app, and the agency’s website.
    
    NASA astronauts Steve Bowen and Frank Rubio will answer prerecorded questions from students through a collaboration with the New Mexico Museum of Space History. The museum is dedicated to telling the story of space exploration and has engaged several school districts in southern New Mexico to participate in the downlink. The museum’s educators traveled to each district and presented information about the space station and its Expedition 69 crew, then worked with the students to develop the questions posed to the astronauts.</p>
  <p>Media interested in covering the event should respond no later than 5 p.m. on Monday, May 29 to Cathy Harper at: cathy.harper@dca.nm.gov or 575-437-2840 x.41153.

    For more than 22 years, astronauts have continuously lived and worked aboard the space station, testing technologies, performing science, and developing the skills needed to explore farther from Earth. Astronauts living in space aboard the orbiting laboratory communicate ]with NASA’s Mission Control Center in Houston 24 hours a day through the Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) Near Space Network.
    
    Important research and technology investigations aboard the International Space Station benefit people on Earth and set the groundwork for future exploration. As part of Artemis, NASA will send astronauts to the Moon to prepare for future human exploration of Mars. Inspiring the next generation of explorers – the Artemis Generation – ensures America will continue to lead in space exploration and discovery.</p>
  <h3>NASA Harnesses US Navy Spinning Device to Simulate Spaceflight</h3>
  <img src="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/thumbnails/image/kraken_main_image.png?itok=haMLlRxw" class="img-fluid" alt="">
  <p>A monster of a machine is now allowing NASA scientists to study on Earth the disorientation that astronauts may encounter in space.

    This machine is the U.S. Navy’s Kraken, a device that can vigorously spin occupants like laundry churning in a washing machine. A new collaboration with the Navy will allow NASA scientists to use the Kraken to build strategies that aim to ease motion sickness. Such strategies may not only help astronauts but could also offer treatment options for patients with balance issues here on Earth.
    
    Astronauts may experience motion sickness on their launch into space and on their return to Earth. Symptoms include dizziness, nausea, and vertigo – a feeling of spinning – which can make it difficult to carry out mission-critical tasks when landing or exiting spacecraft.</p>
  <p>“Shortly after liftoff in the space shuttle, I felt like I was on a merry-go-round as my body hunted for what was up, down, left, and right,” said NASA astronaut Douglas Wheelock. “Crew must prepare for the confusion that they will likely undergo during these gravitational transitions.”

    Enter the Kraken, a 50-foot-long, 100-ton platform at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio. It can be configured to replicate different types of flight to disorient occupants through sudden shifts in roll, pitch, and yaw, superimposed onto horizontal and vertical lurches. A spaceflight setting on the Kraken will allow NASA scientists to study whether a specific technology, coupled with head movements, may help soothe the motion sickness experienced by some astronauts.</p>

  <h3>10-Month Voyage Proves Solar Cell Material Survives, Thrives in Space</h3>
  <img src="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/ubernode_alt_horiz/public/thumbnails/image/misseff_inflight.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
  <p>Dr. Lyndsey McMillon-Brown was hoping to see anything but mustard yellow. When the NASA research electrical engineer clicked open the photo of a small sample – a swatch of film no bigger than a sticky note – she let out a cheer. The film was still dark black after spending 10 months on the International Space Station, proving her team’s innovative solar cell material is suitable for possible use on future space missions.

    McMillon-Brown’s space station-tested sample was part of the first spaceflight demonstration led by NASA’s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland to explore if this new material – called perovskite – is durable and can survive the harsh environment of space. The dark color she saw was an early indication the demonstration had been successful.
    
    Dark black meant the perovskite film was in its most efficient form for absorbing light, while yellow would have meant the crystalline material had degraded into lead iodide, which isn’t useful for solar cells.
    
    NASA Glenn’s perovskite sample can be seen as it was integrated into the MISSE platform at Aegis in Houston, Texas prior to launch to the International Space Station.

    “We didn’t know when we sent it exactly what to expect,” McMillon-Brown said. “It was kind of like opening a door and not knowing what is going to be on the other side.”</p>
  <p>If humanity is to establish a long-term presence on the Moon and Mars, astronauts will need reliable power sources to sustain their habitats and science instruments. NASA researchers think perovskite could be used in solar cells that are thinner, cheaper, lighter, and more flexible than those currently made of silicon or group III and V elements on the periodic table.

    Although perovskites had been put through the experimental paces on Earth, flying in space meant the material could be pummeled by vacuum, extreme temperatures, radiation, and light stressors simultaneously.
    
    “There is no ground analog, no machine that will do all of those crazy things to it at the same time quite like the International Space Station,” McMillon-Brown said.
    
    The 1-inch by 1-inch flight sample was created in a lab in early 2019. Once the thin film met strict safety requirements, it rocketed off to the space station in March 2020 as a part of the Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE). Astronauts performed a spacewalk to open the suitcase-like MISSE platform and attach it to the outside of the space station, exposing the perovskite and other experiments to the extreme conditions of space.</p>
  <h3>NASA’s Artemis II Moon Crew Available for Interviews in Washington</h3>
  <img src="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/thumbnails/image/artemis_ii_crew_for_advisory.jpg?itok=xGveA2e1" class="img-fluid" alt="">
  <p>The four astronauts who will fly around the Moon on NASA’s Artemis II will visit Washington Wednesday, May 17, through Friday, May 19, to discuss their upcoming mission and are available for a limited number of in-person media opportunities.

    The crew will visit the area to speak with members of Congress, meet with leaders at the Canadian Embassy, visit the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, and attend several private events.</p>
  <p>Artemis II is the first crewed mission on NASA’s path to establishing a long-term lunar presence for science and exploration under Artemis and is the first mission with astronauts to the Moon in more than 50 years. The approximately 10-day Artemis II flight test will launch on the agency’s powerful Space Launch System rocket, prove the Orion spacecraft’s life-support systems, and validate the capabilities and techniques needed for humans to live and work in deep space.

    Through Artemis missions, NASA will use innovative technologies to explore more of the lunar surface than ever before and collaborate with commercial and international partners. Then, we will use what we learn on and around the Moon to take the next giant leap: sending the first astronauts to Mars.</p>
