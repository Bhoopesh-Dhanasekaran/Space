  <h3>NASA’s Starling Prepares to Launch Small Spacecraft Swarm to Orbit</h3>
  <img src="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_width_feature/public/thumbnails/image/acd23-0061-056.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
  <p>A quartet of six-unit (6U) CubeSats will show off their moves in a sort of orbital line dance when NASA’s Starling mission tests critical swarm technologies in space. The spacecraft are planned to launch no earlier than July 14 aboard Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket from Rocket Lab’s Launch Complex 1 facility in Mahia, New Zealand.

    Future autonomous spacecraft swarms could change the way NASA conducts science and exploration missions. Spacecraft swarms operating at great distances from the Earth must carry out functions on their own, due to the time delay in communicating with ground stations and potential communications disruptions. Autonomy will ensure that a mission continues to perform even when communications with spacecraft are temporarily disrupted. Additionally, autonomy allows spacecraft swarms to change behavior to observe unexpected or infrequent phenomena – referred to by researchers as “opportunistic science.”
    
    Once positioned about 355 miles above Earth and spaced about 40 miles apart, Starling’s spacecraft will demonstrate the ability to autonomously fly together while keeping track of each other’s relative positions and trajectories. They also will demonstrate the ability to plan and execute activities as a group, without guidance from mission controllers, including responding to new information from onboard sensors. Starling’s spacecraft will also demonstrate creating and maintaining an inter-spacecraft communications network that automatically adjusts to changing conditions. If one spacecraft communications node fails, the network automatically reconfigures to maintain full communication capabilities for the remaining operational spacecraft in the swarm.</p>
  <p>NASA has partnered with American academic institutions and small businesses to provide key technologies and support mission operations for Starling’s technology demonstration. Partners include small businesses from NASA’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which provides early-stage funding and ongoing support for research, development, and demonstration of innovative technologies that fulfill NASA needs. These partnerships will advance space exploration capabilities and create jobs through the growth of commercial space companies that will both use and provide new technologies.

    In this photo engineers from NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley and Rocket Lab USA, Inc., of Long Beach, California recently teamed up at NASA Ames to integrate Starling’s four spacecraft into Rocket Lab CubeSat dispensers ahead of launch. The spacecraft, each about the size of two stacked cereal boxes, were provided by Blue Canyon Technologies of Boulder, Colorado.
    
    NASA Ames leads the Starling project. NASA’s Small Spacecraft Technology program, based at NASA Ames and within NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD), funds and manages the Starling mission. Blue Canyon Technologies designed and manufactured the spacecraft buses and is providing mission operations support. Rocket Lab USA, Inc. provides launch and integration services. Partners supporting Starling’s payload experiments include Stanford University’s Space Rendezvous Lab in Stanford, California, Emergent Space Technologies of Laurel, Maryland, CesiumAstro of Austin, Texas, L3Harris Technologies, Inc., of Melbourne, Florida, and NASA Ames – with funding support by NASA’s Game Changing Development program within STMD.

  <h3>NASA’s Laser Communications Relay: A Year of Experimentation</h3>
  <img src="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/side_image/public/thumbnails/image/lcrd_1920x1080_notext_0.png?itok=D3LkH7XM" class="img-fluid" alt="">
  <p>NASA’s first two-way laser relay system completed its first year of experiments on June 28 – a milestone for a game-changing technology that could be the future for sending and receiving data from space.

    The Laser Communications Relay Demonstration (LCRD) uses infrared light, or invisible lasers, to transmit and receive signals rather than radio wave systems conventionally used on spacecraft. Infrared light’s tight wavelengths allow space missions to pack significantly more data – 10 to 100 times more - into a single transmission. More data means more discoveries.
    
    Now, at the halfway point in its experimentation phase, LCRD has shown laser communications’ significant advantages over traditional radio wave systems.

    Located in geosynchronous orbit 22,000 miles above Earth, LCRD is currently acting as an experiment platform for NASA, other government agencies, academia, and commercial companies to test laser communications capabilities. After its experiment phase, there is an opportunity for the mission to become an operational relay. This would mean that future missions using laser communications would not need a clear line of sight to Earth and would simply send their data to LCRD, which would then beam it down to Earth.</p>
  <p>LCRD, and laser communications in general, was born out of a need for more efficient data transmission to and from space. LCRD was launched to test and refine this technology through a partnership between NASA’s Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) program and NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate.

    “So far, we’ve published first papers about early findings from the experiments, but we plan to publish more lessons learned so that the aerospace industry can learn from this technology demonstration alongside NASA,” said Dave Israel, LCRD’s principal investigator at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “Early results have been outstanding, and seeing massive amounts of data come down in a fraction of the time is truly extraordinary.”
    
    Some of these experiments include studying atmospheric impact on laser signals. While laser communications can normally provide increased data rates, humidity, clouds, heavy winds, and other atmospheric disturbances can disrupt laser signals as they enter Earth’s atmosphere.

    “One of the things that surprised us was how weather affected experiment operations. We typically build our ground stations in remote, high-altitude locations with clear weather conditions – LCRD’s are in Hawaii and California,” said Rick Butler, LCRD experiments manager at Goddard. “The historic rain and snowfall in Southern California this year provided us an opportunity to really understand the impacts of weather on signal availability. This also reinforced our understanding that more ground stations mean more options for signal availability.”
    
    Additionally, the weather experiment allowed engineers to enhance NASA’s adaptive optics systems, which are integrated into the ground stations and use a sensor to measure and correct distortion on the signal that's coming down from the spacecraft.</p>
  <p>Another experiment was conducted with the Aerospace Corporation, who built an LCRD-compatible terminal to send and receive data with LCRD. This experiment confirmed LCRD’s ability to work with external users.

    Engineers also used LCRD as an opportunity to test networking capabilities like delay/disruption tolerant networking (DTN) over laser links. DTN empowers missions with unparalleled connectivity by storing and forwarding data at points along a network to ensure critical information reaches its destination.
    
    Laser communications systems also can enable more precise navigation capabilities. An ongoing navigation experiment has shown engineers can receive more precise location data over a laser link than over standard radio waves. This means that the laser communications system can also serve as a platform for improved timing and location data — a critical part of GPS.

    “Technology demonstrations like LCRD allow NASA and its partners to implement new capabilities and test them in an operational scenario,” said Trudy Kortes, director of technology demonstrations in NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate at the agency's headquarters in Washington. “This enables engineers to really get a feel for a technology’s potential and see what future applications could look like. It’s why testing operations in a relevant environment is so critical.”</p>
    <p>With systems like LCRD proving the capabilities of laser communications, future science and human exploration missions that adopt the technology could be capable of transmitting more data back to Earth. As science missions’ instrumentation advances and gathers more data, the onboard communications systems must also evolve to transmit this data to researchers. Payloads like LCRD are showing how laser communications systems can benefit space missions and help them achieve their science objectives.

      LCRD is one of a series of missions to demonstrate laser communications technology. The agency is continuing its infusion efforts with future terminals going on the International Space Station, the Artemis II Orion spacecraft that will travel around the Moon, and the Deep Space Optical Communications experiment aboard the Psyche spacecraft, which will test laser communications farther from Earth than ever before as Psyche makes its way to its asteroid destination in deep space.
      
      With a year of successful experimentation completed, the LCRD team is now prepping for the late 2023 launch of NASA’s Integrated LCRD Low-Earth Orbit User Modem and Amplifier Terminal, or ILLUMA-T. Once on the space station, ILLUMA-T will send experiment data to LCRD, which will then relay it to the ground. This will allow NASA to test low Earth orbit to geosynchronous orbit laser communications and showcase the benefit of LCRD’s relay capabilities.</p>

      <h3>Four Teams Win Prizes to Advance Energy Technology for Moon Missions</h3>
  <img src="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/thumbnails/image/icymi_wattsonthemoon.jpg?itok=oC5wy1JU" class="img-fluid" alt="">
  <p>NASA has selected four teams to advance to the final level of the agency’s Watts on the Moon Challenge, which seeks solutions to transmit and store energy on the lunar surface.

    NASA is working to establish a permanent human presence on the Moon and beyond. The next major step in this effort will be Artemis II, the first crewed test flight to the Moon since the Apollo program. Long-term exploratory missions on the Moon will require many technologies, such as lunar habitats, life support systems, and rovers – all of which need efficient sources of power.</p>
  <p>Providing power on the Moon is a complex challenge. Because of the particulars of the Moon’s orbit, the lunar night lasts nearly two weeks, creating long periods of extreme darkness and cold temperatures. For humans to live and work on the Moon for an extended period of time, solutions for storing, distributing, and managing energy for use throughout the lunar cycle are essential. Watts on the Moon challenges teams to come up with new technologies to address these areas.

    "As we tread new ground in exploration, we'll need to draw on creativity across the nation," said Denise Morris, acting program manager for Centennial Challenges at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. "The technologies created through Watts on the Moon are one example, with new perspectives helping us address a crucial technology gap."
    
    Phase 2, Level 2, of the challenge began in August 2022 and tasked teams to further develop key components of solutions developed in Phase 2, Level 1. The Level 2 winning teams were awarded $400,000 each and will advance to Phase 2, Level 3.</p>
  <h3>NASA Engineers Help Create A Virtual World of Data</h3>
  <img src="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/thumbnails/image/nasavr.png?itok=7BFiDDzq" class="img-fluid" alt="">
  <p>For almost as long as it’s been a concept, NASA has been on the cutting edge of virtual reality (VR) technology. However, the space has seen a renaissance since the bulky headsets of the 1990s. Several high-profile companies now use VR for immersive video games and virtual chat rooms, but to some, this technology has a use beyond entertainment.

    NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California has been trying to improve data visualization for decades. When pictures come back from an alien world, scientists usually survey the environment with a panoramic photo, but this method has limitations. When observing a flat image, judging distances can be difficult.
    
    “Looking at pictures on a screen is a much different experience to walking through a canyon,” said Scott Davidoff, manager of the Human Centered Design Group at JPL.</p>
  <p>Davidoff began experimenting with VR using image data from the Curiosity rover on Mars. There had been attempts to solve the visual distance issue, like using 3D imagery viewable with red and blue filtered glasses, but nothing made scientists feel like they were really there. Davidoff and his colleagues decided to wrap the panorama around the scientist in a virtual environment. Geologists using VR in this way reported feeling like they were in the real Martian environment. They could ascertain the distance and size of features much more quickly and accurately than they could with a flat display, which sparked another idea. Davidoff thought that if viewing imagery in VR helped, it could be a game changer for more complex “multi-dimensional” data.

    “When you look at a network diagram as a system in 3D, it turns out your perception does something different,” Davidoff said. “We made a data world where an analyst could look at any science or engineering problem and see patterns and correlations more clearly than they can in a flat version.”
    
    At the same time, Ciro Donalek and George Djorgovski at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) were researching how to use immersive environments for scientific data visualization and collaboration.</p>
  <h3>NASA Offers Fly-Fix-Fly Testing for SmallSat Planetary Observation</h3>
  <img src="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/thumbnails/image/tamu-gorr-integration_img5108.jpg?itok=Vw1hhwQ8" class="img-fluid" alt="">
  <p>After a 12-day stratospheric flight, winners of NASA’s first TechLeap Prize are now analyzing data from technologies that may improve autonomous observation capabilities for small spacecraft flying over Earth, the Moon, or other worlds. Their payloads were selected through the TechLeap Autonomous Observation Challenge No. 1, which asked teams to develop technologies to autonomously detect, locate, track, and collect data on short-lived events, such as wildfires, unique aerosol dispersions like dust and steam plumes, or events on other planetary bodies such as geysers on the icy moons of Saturn and Jupiter. 

    NASA’s Flight Opportunities program, managed at Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California, enabled three research teams to fly, fix issues, and fly again less than a year after their first individual flight tests. This second high-altitude balloon flight with all three payloads aboard cost-efficiently gave the teams a longer sensing and data collection opportunity. Those teams were the SEAK (Systems Engineering, Architecture, and Knowledge) Lab at Texas A&M University in College Station; Bronco Space at Cal Poly Pomona in California; and Orion Labs, a small applied robotic research institution in Nunn, Colorado.</p>
  <p>This latest flight launched from Hurley, South Dakota, on May 24 on a high-altitude balloon from Sioux Falls-based Aerostar. The teams worked collaboratively while integrating their payloads for the flight, helping each other solve various technical issues prior to launch.

    While the balloon was expected to hover over a specific area for several days, a storm carried it much farther south. Aerostar worked hard to bring the balloon back on track, but the teams were able to observe only some of their intended targets. However, the flight still achieved the goal of enabling researchers to collect long-term sensing data and experience a simulation of the environments in which their technologies may operate.</p>
  <h3>Satellite Swarms for Science ‘Grow up’ at NASA Ames</h3>
  <img src="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/thumbnails/image/starling_1.png?itok=sg6PdzXQ" class="img-fluid" alt="">
  <p>Teamwork makes the dream work, and at NASA that doesn’t apply only to humans. Researchers at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley are developing satellite swarms, which are groups of spacecraft working together as a unit, without being managed individually by mission controllers. A swarm’s ability to perform autonomously will make new types of science and exploration possible, particularly as they venture farther into deep space.</p>
  <p>Ames’ work on swarm technologies has been underway for decades. This summer, swarm science will reach a major milestone as NASA launches the Starling mission into space. It will test technologies that let four spacecraft operate in a coordinated manner without resources from the ground. And the results of Starling’s experiments will be of great interest to researchers at Ames who, right now, are preparing a future swarm mission to study the Sun.</p>
